                    Argubaly the unsung hero of the iPhone 15 line, the iPhone 15 Pro remains one of the best phones on the market right now, especially if you're looking for a compact smartphone with high-end specs; handily outpacing newer rivals, like Samsung's Galaxy S24. While Pro iPhone pricing always takes a while to start falling, since launch it's started to creep down in the UK, while retailers in the US and Australia haven't yet budged on original pricing. As for the user experience, Apple has since pushed out new features to iOS 17, especially in select markets like the EU, where sideloading is now on the table. Beyond these minor adjustments, however, the rest of this review remains as previously published.

                    If we were to judge the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra on nothing but its cameras and, in particular, the optical and digitally-enhanced zoom capabilities, we might call it the best smartphone ever. Or at least, the best phone of 2022. Its successor has since been announced though, so check out our full Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra review for a deep-dive of that. We also have a Samsung Galaxy S23 review and a Samsung Galaxy S23 Plus review. Of course, even before its successor landed, it wouldn't have been fair to judge the S22 Ultra as the best based on its cameras alone – every handset is the sum of its design, features, components, utility, and value – but taken as a whole, this Samsung Galaxy Series-Galaxy Note hybrid is an excellent, albeit massive Android handset that not only ticks all the important boxes, but delivers more features than you may ever want or use.

                    If you want a Huawei P40 Pro badly enough, you’ll be able to make the most of this handset – it offers a luxurious design, long lasting battery life and one of the best cameras we’ve ever seen on a phone. For the average user, though, this isn’t a phone we’d recommend. Owing to the Huawei ban in the US, the phone doesn’t have Google Mobile Services, meaning the handset doesn’t have access to popular Android apps like the Google Play Store, YouTube, Gmail and a multitude of others. In our time with the Huawei P40 Pro, we found this to be frustrating and it bordered on defeating the object of having a smartphone in 2020. Not being able to access the services we use on Android devices every day hampered our experience of using the Huawei P40 Pro, and it’s likely you’d find the same.
